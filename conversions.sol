// What are UINTs?
/* 
    - The "uint" data type is an 'unsigned integer', meaning its value must be non-negative.
    - There is also an "int" data type for 'signed integer'.


    NOTE: In Solidity, "uint" is actually an alias for uint256, a 256-bit unsigned integer.
    = When you write "uint", it defaults to uint256!
    - You can declare "uints" with less bits - uint8, uint16, uint32, uint48, etc...
    - But in general you want to simply use "uint" except in specific cases
