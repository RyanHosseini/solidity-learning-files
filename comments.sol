/* 
Comments in Solidity: They are a way to document our code

Solidity supports both C-style (multi-line) and C++-style (single-line) comments, Thus - 

    Single lines: Any text between a // and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by Solidity Compilter.

    Multi lines: Any text between the charaters / * and * / is treated as a comment. This may span multiple lines.

*/

/* C-style - multi-line comments */

// C++-style - single-line comments

/* 

There are two ways to write our comments in Solidity:
    - Using // (single-line comment) - (C++-style)
    - Using / * * / (multi-line comment) - (C-style)
*/

// * (asterisk) - / (forward slash)

// / * this opens the comment and this * / closes the comment
